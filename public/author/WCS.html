						<h3><a href="../../comedy/5/">Facts</a></h3>
						<p>Disturbing fact:</p>
<p>One recent study found that seventy percent of people with genital herpes contracted the virus from a partner with no visible signs of an outbreak.</p>
<p>More disturbing fact:</p>
<p>This means that thirty percent of people contracted the virus from someone who they could clearly see had a genital herpes outbreak.</p>

						<h3><a href="../../comedy/9/">Wikipedia History</a></h3>
						<p>After reading an entire Wikipedia article, I have reproduced this famous scene from the William McKinley administration.</p>
<p>-President McKinley, have you signed the Hawaiian Territorial Annexation Act of 1898 yet?<br/>-What’s today? July 6th, 1898? I think I’ll sign it today.<br/>-If you have any legal questions, we can run them by attorney general John W. Griggs.<br/>-I thought the attorney general was Joseph McKenna.<br/>-He was. But then you appointed him to the Supreme Court on January 25th.<br/>-Oh, I forgot. I’m famously forgetful. Ever since I was a child in Niles, Ohio.<br/>-That’s OK, Major. Your nickname is Major.<br/>-You know, lately I’ve been preoccupied thinking about the Dingley Tariff of 1897. I ...</p>

						<h3><a href="../../comedy/21/">At the Movies</a></h3>
						<p><b>On the Road…Again?</b><br/>Harold Perelman</p>
<p>As award season approaches, expect a new crop of Oscar bait to roll into your local cinemá. Aside from the usual foreign flicks and Holocaust weepies – Schindler, party of 6 million? - the top contenders are usually celluloid versions of books you were supposed to read for your high school Lit class. The latest offering from director Brian Levant (<i>Jingle all the Way, Problem Child II</i>) falls squarely into this last category, and proves just how controversial, frustrating, and ultimately rewarding film adaptations can be.</p>
<p>It took fifty-five years for Hollywood to adapt Jack Kerouac’s <i>On the Road.</i> Though Frank Coppola and Gus Sant were once rumored to be attached to the project, studios ...</p>

						<h3><a href="../../comedy/39/">Henry Frick</a></h3>
						<p>Henry Clay Frick was born in 1849, but that’s not the half of it. By 1871 he was doing his thing and by 1880 he didn’t take no for an answer. In 1881 he met Andrew Carnegie, of Gilded Age fame. It was something of an open secret that the search was on for a new chairman at Carnegie’s steel company, Carnegie Steel Company. Frick was born for the job, in 1849. </p>
<p>Story goes something like this. Frick walks right into that building, skips the elevator, skips the stairs, bursts through the door and all but screams “brass tax.” Carnegie looks up from his papers or whatever, motions for Frick to sit in one of those big ...</p>

						<h3><a href="../../comedy/51/">Motown</a></h3>
						<p>Was Motown pop music a force for social change, or a feel-good excuse to maintain the racial status quo? Look at these hit song titles and decide for yourself. </p>

						<h3><a href="../../comedy/61/">Steve Loves Doritos</a></h3>
						<p>Daniel: Well, the apartment was a decent size, but still pretty expensive for a one-bedroom.<br/>Rob: Yeah, this is definitely a renter’s market. I think you can afford – <br/>Steve: Hey guys, you talking Doritos? <br/>Rob:  Come on, Steve. Don’t do this again.<br/>Steve: I just thought maybe you were having the old Doritos discussion.<br/>Daniel: Dude, for the last time: we’ll tell you if we ever have a conversation about Doritos. <br/>Steve: You promise? <br/>Rob: Of course, Steve. We know how you love Doritos. <br/>Daniel: Yeah, man. Everyone knows.<br/></p>
