					<h3>Hardy Boys<span class="byline">by <a href="../../author/KPB/">KPB ’10–’12</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>“Look out!” shouted Joe Hardy as a bomb headed for a woman’s purse.</p>
<p>“Phew, that was close,” said his brother Frank as it missed. Together they were the Hardy Boys©.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like that souped-up motorboat is supposed to be in the water,” said Joe, manning the mast of their schooner the S.S. Sleuth as Frank pulled out a megaphone. “Stop, dead to rights!” he yelled. “Citizen’s arrest!”</p>
<p>That’s when the shady figures on the motorboat started yelling in a suspicious foreign language. Joe deduced that it was probably Spanish on account of the recent problems Bayport was having with illegals.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the motorboat stopped—dead to rights.</p>
<p>“Knuckleheads,” cursed Frank.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what are you trying to do, wreck down here or something?” shouted Joe. “Shoot!”</p>
<p>Frank jotted down some clues on his detective pad—like how the leaves were changing with the season. “The boat is named MS-13,” he gleaned.</p>
<p>“Probably for the thirteen knuckleheads on board,” Joe joked.</p>
<p>Frank chuckled. “You know, I have a hunch that the school’s missing football pennant just might be onboard with those characters.”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” said Joe, handing his brother a flashlight and a wink. “Let’s put these boys away. I hear Peggy Sue is having a necking party tonight.”</p>
