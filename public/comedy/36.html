					<h3>Great Movies<span class="byline">by <a href="../../author/SAL-G/">SAL-G ’11</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>Men and women like different movies, but Hollywood has introduced a new hybrid genre that anyone can enjoy. Below, snippets from some upcoming films:<br/> <br/>—A man removes a red velvet ring box from his pocket. He is going to propose. Then, suddenly, from his other pocket he takes out a green velvet ring box. One box has a ring. The other box has a bomb. The woman has to choose within fifteen seconds. If she chooses the right box, she can spend the next fifteen minutes of the movie picking out a wedding dress.</p>
<p>—A woman, crying, gets into a taxi headed for the airport. A man, chasing after her, gets into a second taxi, saying, “Follow that car!” Another man, wielding a machete, gets into a third taxi and says: “Go to the airport or die!” A tank, commanded by the male love interest, brings up the rear.<br/> <br/>—A man is surrounded by his friends in a bar, and they make a bet that he has one month to find a girlfriend who is a brunette because he has mostly dated blondes. Meanwhile, in another part of the bar, a female Russian spy with brown hair looks for an American male with moderate to low intelligence to use as a decoy boyfriend. Meanwhile, in a top-secret part of the bar, the President gives an order to shoot and kill all Russian spies.</p>
