					<h3>Karoake<span class="byline">by <a href="../../author/MKG/">MKG ’10</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>What I always hope my friends will say when I get back to our table after doing karaoke:</p>
<p>“Did you take voice lessons when you were younger?”<br/>“Have you ever thought about seriously pursuing a music career?”<br/>“I finally understand why you hate kids in a capella groups: it’s not because you’re jealous of them, it’s because you’re significantly better at singing.”<br/>“What blew me away was that you were really good but it looked like you weren’t even trying your hardest. It was as if you didn’t care and found the whole thing kind of corny.”<br/>“You definitely weren’t awkward at all, especially during the instrumental parts.”<br/>“When we were all screaming “Encore! Encore!”  we were being serious and not sarcastic at all. We were completely sober and really wanted to hear you sing another song.”<br/>“The only reason you got less applause than the fat guy who went before you was because he was much worse than you and needed more encouragement.”<br/>“Hey guys, sorry I’m late – my brother was having a crisis. As you know, he’s the manager of The Strokes and their lead singer just got the flu and will have to miss their upcoming worldwide tour. Do you guys have any idea where I could find a replacement? They want someone with no professional experience.”<br/></p>
