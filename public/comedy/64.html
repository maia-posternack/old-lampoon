					<h3>Sweet Sixteen Speech<span class="byline">by <a href="/">RIP ’09</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>My Speech for Tonight</p>
<p>Hi everyone.  I’m Jess’s father.  Thank you all for coming to Jess’s sweet sixteen.  It seems like only yesterday that my daughter was fifteen years, eleven months, and twenty-nine days old.  [pause for laughs]  All kidding aside, I want to keep this brief and say to my little girl how proud I am to be her father.  Jess, I love you with all my heart, and I thank God every day that I’m the lucky guy who gets to be your father.  [pull out gun and shoot neighbor]  Everyone stay calm!  There’s no need to panic.  The man I killed is not a human.  He is a robot.  Look.  Look at his chest.  [pull out the wires]  Do you see these?  Robot wires.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have reason to believe that eight months ago this robot killed and ate my real human neighbor with the intent to spy on me and my family, and I could not let that happen.  I invited him here tonight to confirm once and for all whether he was man or machine, and I did that by studying his response to a tender moment between father and daughter that would sway even the hardest of human hearts.  As suspected, this robot did not even bat an eye.  I apologize for scaring everyone, but you have to understand that I had to outwit that robot.  Please relax and enjoy the rest of the party.  Jess, I love you.  Also don’t forget to- [pull out gun, shoot dentist] Everyone stay calm!  That was it.  That was the last robot, I promise.  Take a look at his wires.  This robot was also going to kill me and my family, but it’s over now.  Anyway, what I was going to say before is don’t forget to sign Jess’s poster board.<br/></p>
