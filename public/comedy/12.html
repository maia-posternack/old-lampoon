					<h3>My Literotica.com Story<span class="byline">by <a href="../../author/KMM/">KMM ’10</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter: thus spoke the undersides of her ample bosom, as they romantically slapped her ribcage. Sloop plop plop; patter patter patter. I was finally sexing my neighbor – who was 41 but also a virgin because her husband had died twenty years ago today on their honeymoon from a penis disease.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” I said, trying to hold up my penis to show her that I had no diseases there. But it was too late: my penis was already gone in her body.</p>
<p>“Ouch! Oh! Ahhhhhhhhhhh,” she moaned, as I took her virginity and initiated the first of her many orgasms. “Oh my God,” she said, looking up into my eyes as she micro-orgasmed.</p>
<p>“Now it’s my turn,” I thought out loud. “Ahhhhhhhhrrrrrrggggghhhhhh!” I yelled as I seeded her. “Whoa!” I realized that my legs were weak from the exercise of sex.</p>
<p>“You think it’s over?” she cooed, making my erection not go away and stay really strong. I had just orgasmed but everything was still hard because I am a young man.</p>
<p>But before we could once again simultaneously orgasm, we were interrupted by a knock at the door.</p>
<p>“Hello sir,” said a man in a suit. “Consider yourself served.” It looked like my estranged wife had finally decided to go through with our divorce. It turned out I didn’t have to feel guilty for sexing this woman, I thought, letting the ripples of another orgasm lap against my body from her body – the source of the orgasm ripples.</p>
<p>“You complete me,” I said later, sexing upstairs in the bed. “I think I may love you.”</p>
<p>“You mean that you love the sex we have!” she joked as I lay on top of her and entered her perpendicularly, still completely erect.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, pumping.</p>
<p>“Do you mean marriageeeeeeeeee?” she squealed, orgasming.</p>
<p>“I want to get married…but we can’t because you’re my sister.” Everything went quiet. I had just revealed to her that I knew she was my sister all along. It was so wrong.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, brother,” she said to me, her brother. She must have known all along. “I knew all along,” she said, confirming everything.</p>
<p>I felt my groin get hot.</p>
<p>Jenny eventually passed away from a disease, but I still think about her and the great sex we used to have.</p>
<p>I love you Jenny.</p>
