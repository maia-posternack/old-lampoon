					<h3>Wikipedia History<span class="byline">by <a href="../../author/WCS/">WCS ’11</a></span></a></h3>
						<p>After reading an entire Wikipedia article, I have reproduced this famous scene from the William McKinley administration.</p>
<p>-President McKinley, have you signed the Hawaiian Territorial Annexation Act of 1898 yet?<br/>-What’s today? July 6th, 1898? I think I’ll sign it today.<br/>-If you have any legal questions, we can run them by attorney general John W. Griggs.<br/>-I thought the attorney general was Joseph McKenna.<br/>-He was. But then you appointed him to the Supreme Court on January 25th.<br/>-Oh, I forgot. I’m famously forgetful. Ever since I was a child in Niles, Ohio.<br/>-That’s OK, Major. Your nickname is Major.<br/>-You know, lately I’ve been preoccupied thinking about the Dingley Tariff of 1897. I have a feeling that some historians will call it the defining accomplishment of my first term.<br/>-But what about the Civil Service Reform Act of 1898?<br/>-What about it?<br/>-I’d say it amounted to an effective reorganization of several cabinet level departments, including but not limited to the Department of War and the Department of the Interior. Am I right or am I right?<br/>-I know Speaker of the House Thomas Bracket would say so!<br/>-(laughs)  That is quite the ironic statement, since Speaker Bracket actually led Congressional opposition to that bill.<br/>-Yes. He did.<br/>-…<br/>-…<br/>-President McKinley, I have a rather personal question… Do you think…do you think that our nation’s currency should be pegged in value to a fixed quantity of gold?<br/>-It sounds like you are talking about the gold standard. The gold standard has been in place since 1873. The gold standard is very important to me.<br/>-I see.<br/>-OK, now I’m gonna go do the Spanish-American War.<br/>-You truly are the best twenty-fifth President this nation could have asked for.<br/>-You really mean it?<br/>-Of course. One day they’ll name mountains after you. Tall ones, in Alaska.<br/>-What’s Alaska?<br/>-It’s a territory, not a state. Yet.</p>
